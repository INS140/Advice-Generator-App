### What I learned

This project has been a good resource for me to practice using APIs and React. I gained some important knowledge about handling fetch requests and state in a React app.

### Continued development

I plan to develop more complex React apps in the future. I've been setting my sights on some of the more difficult [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) projects.
